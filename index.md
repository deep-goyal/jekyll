# **Hello!**

---

 My name is Deep Goyal, and I'm an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UGTA) for Dr. Josh Daymude's CSE 355 course at Arizona State University.

This website is a collection of supplemental resources I am creating to help you succeed in the course. Here you will find study guides, conceptual videos made with Manim, and other materials to support your learning.

I hope you find them helpful!
